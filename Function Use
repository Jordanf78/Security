Call hashCollector(folders) on all the folders with subdirectories to be hashed
Once you have a dictionary with all of these combined, we can move onto the comparison.

availableDrives() - returns letter names of drives for storage/access

use storeHashes(DRIVE, dict) to store locally, not on Google Drive

# for comparing the files

if (os.path.exists(DRIVE + r’SecurityFolder\HashFile.txt’)):
	compareHashes(hashCollectorDict, dict from above) #not made yet
else:
	privateKeyEnc, vector = removeFromFile(DRIVE)
	if privateKeyEnc != “FILEDNE”:
		#get password from user
		privateKey = decryptKey(password, vector, privateKeyEnc)
		decryptFile(DRIVE, encryptedFilePath, privateKey)
	else:
		#do error handling
# for storing the files
privateKey = encryptFile(DRIVE, hashFile)
message, vector = encryptKey(password, privateKey)
storeInFile(vector, message, DRIVE)
