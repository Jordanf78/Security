1) The user runs the program for the first time and the base hashes file is made.
2) The user then selects the option in the main menu to either hash their selected directories or to select the directories that they want to be checked for changes.
3) If the user hits the hash option, the selected files in the directories are hashed and compared against previous stored hashes to check for changes.
4) Once the hashing is complete, the files with changed values are displayed for the user.
5) The user can then select directories from this list that they do not want to be hashed again in the future.
6) If the user selects the option to select directories, then they can deselect particular files or directories that they do not want to be hashed to be checked for changes.
